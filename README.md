# DataBall
DataBall makes it easier than ever to not only compare players historical data, filtered via year and position, but also gamify your experience to allow you to create and tweak your own “dream team”, giving you practical hands on experience with how certain stats affect an overall team's performance. Lastly, once your team is formed, checkout how it matches up against real historical teams’ statistics! (i.e., try to make the best team that stands the test of time).
